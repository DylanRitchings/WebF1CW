<h2 class = "litHeader">Mitigating Corporate Information Exposure</h2>

<p>The purpose of this report is to show how corporations aim 
to mitigate the impacts of or prevent information exposure. 
I will be focusing on companies that outsource their data to 
other firms, use cloud computing and companies that have data 
that different people within the company have access to. I 
will be writing about encryption, different strategies to stop
 information from being viewable by unauthorised people with
 hardware and software and how information outsourcing firms 
 should be transparent with their clients when they data gets
 leaked.</p>
<p>
Information exposure usually begins with social engineering 
where people use influence and persuasion to deceive people to
 gain information (Kevin D. Mitnick, 2001). Mitnick writes 
 about how employees are as important as software and hardware.
 Using security technologies and security policies for employee
 behaviour can mitigate information exposure. They should be 
 trained to be aware that there are people trying to manipulate
 them into giving away information. They should know how to 
 protect their information and be aware what the companyâ€™s 
 security policies and procedures are. Employees should also 
 know that they are protecting their own private information as
 well as their job.
</p>

<p>
In Economics of Privacy (Yosra Miaoui, 2015) it is said that 
outsourcing information to different companies comes with a 
level of risk and can decrease the privacy of the data so 
companies that do not outsource their private data could have 
less privacy issues. It also says that once private data is 
stolen how the data is misused and when it is misused depends 
on the lifetime of the data therefor to figure out how to 
protect the data or if it should be outsourced at all companies
 must assess the degree of vulnerability and how much it can be
 misused by a cyber attacker. They also write companies who use
 outsourced data must tell the company whose data they have 
 anything that has happened with the data straight away. This 
 means the company will be able to act on any data exposure and 
 can start to make the data stolen useless. This mostly will 
 reduce the financial damage that has occurred but more damage 
 will occur until the end of the data lifetime.
</p>

<p>
Most corporations including health organisations will encrypt 
any information being outsourced many of them use attribute 
based encryption. (Ming Li Member, 2012) Attribute based 
encryption allows multiple users to access the encrypted data 
this is unlike other methods used to encrypt health records 
before.
</p>
<p>
Many corporations use cloud computing to store their data. 
There are many security issues with cloud computing including
 there is no knowledge where the data runs, who controls the 
 encryption and decryption keys and many more. 
 (Rachna Arora, 2013) RSA Algorithm distributes a public key to
 all workstations that can encrypt the message and a private key
 which is not shared. When the user wants to access the file the
cloud provider will check if the user has access and if so will 
send the data.
</p>
<p>
In large corporations, different information should be put into 
separate categories so people in different departments can only 
view their data (Kevin D. Mitnick, 2001). In government 
organisations, this can be either classified or unclassified. 
Organizations put information in levels of sensitivity this 
stops people from accessing data they should not be allowed to 
see (Jerome H. Saltzer, 2017). Data can be written to a lower 
level of sensitivity by accident or if a user is infected by a 
trojan horse. To stop data from getting to lower levels the Bell
 and LaPadula model is used (Irvine, 2014), a person reading 
 highly sensitive information sets what level they are in so they
 are unable to write to lower sensitivity levels. Also, events 
 can be used to alert the user if a security violation is 
 occurring and any printed documents should have a blank face 
 with a title of the level of sensitivity it is from. There are 
 two types of threats that occur with multilevel security systems.
 Developmental are flaws in the system through mistakes in design
 and implementation this can be avoided by testing the system before
 it is put in use. Operational are flaws where insiders are used to
 let external activities occur.
</p>
<p>
Stopping information exposure from occurring can be simple and have
 nothing to do with the software side of computers, doors containing
 computers can be locked, controlling who can change the hardware 
 can stop people without authorization from taking information from
 hard drives, shield the computers so electromagnetic radiation 
 cannot be used to gain access, telling staff to keep IDs hidden when
 outside the building so the ID cannot be reproduced. 
 (Jerome H. Saltzer, 2017).
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, organisations can aim to deter people from trying to 
gain their information (Committee on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing
 Strategies and Developing, 2010). This can be achieved by threatening
 the attacker, this is usually only done by governments. This harm can
 be achieved by making the attack too costly by defending, or by 
 retaliating. Deterrence by retaliating can cost less than defending 
 but might not get as much deterrence for other attacks from this. 
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, organisations should know that threats of information 
exposure cannot be completely removed. The threats can be reduced by 
teaching employees to be aware of the threats and how to avoid being 
socially engineered, using correct software in an efficient way to 
stop cyber-attacks or accidental exposure, encrypting information,
 putting different types of information into different categories, 
 locking doors to stop people from accessing systems they should not
 have access to, deterring people from trying to gain the information
 and more that have not been discussed in this review.
